 developing mobile and web applications.

I started learning to code last year when I was 18 years old because I wanted to become a 
webdeveloper and build my own websites and usful applications, I have gained knowledge in designing

But my skill is in drinking coffee, I drink coffee everday, at least 1 cup of coffee
a day, I love the smell of coffee in the morning, it makes me feel awake and ready to
 take on the day. It feel amazing to drink coffee while coding.

 I love learing new things, I have an open mind to learn new things, I believe that learning is a lifelong journey and
 I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I also love learning languages, I can speak Khmer, English and a bit of Chinese
